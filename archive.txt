            <h2>1. Most of Us aren't Ready</h2>
            <p>In 2021, the NRRI (National Retirement Readiness Index) published by Chulalongkorn University revealed that less than 50% of Thais have adequate savings or investments for retirement.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is particularly concerning for Generation Z and younger individuals due to several factors including:</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                <li>Increasing ease & ways for frictionless spending</li>
                <li>Rising cost of living due to lowered restriction in foreign ownership law</li>
                <li>Increasing shift towards freelance & online jobs with less stable income</li>
                <li>Lowered attraction towards civil servants with retirement pension</li>
                <li>Continuous lack of basic financial literacy education in school</li>
            </p>

                    <p>Its UI is perhaps the pinnacle for most professional traders but its ticker board design demands a lot of cognitive loads. It's also not the most engaging for beginners or the most attractive compared to other international platforms.

                    <p>Investing abbreviations are used all around the platform without any explaination provided. So investors have to rely on external sources while some turn to social media for help and risk receiving the wrong or misleading information.

                    <p>Unfortunately, stock manipulation is a daily occurrence in SET. Streaming's lack of warnings and its abbreviations does little to remind investors to stay cautious and have second thoughts before opening a trade.

                    <p>The inconvenience of odd lot orders and the minimum of 100 shares required for each buy/sell order on Streaming makes large-cap stocks with lower volatility inaccessible to some beginners and investors with low starting capital.
